# AWS-ML-Email-Spam-Detection

This repo contains resources and code to setup a pipeline on AWS which implements a machine learning model to predict whether a Email is spam or not. 
Here we create a system that upon receipt of an email message, automatically flags it as spam or not, based on the prediction obtained from the machine learning model.
